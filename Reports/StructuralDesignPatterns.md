## Objectives :

**1. Study the Structural Design Patterns**

**2. Implement them in real projects**

## Theory :

Design patterns are a group of predefined solutions that help in solving different common programming problems. Mainly Design Patterns are divided into 3 categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral.
Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.

- _Adapter Pattern_
  Adapting an interface into another according to client expectation.

- _Bridge Pattern_
  Separating abstraction (interface) from implementation.

- _Composite Pattern_
  Allowing clients to operate on hierarchy of objects.

- _Decorator Pattern_
  Adding functionality to an object dynamically.

- _Facade Pattern_
  Providing an interface to a set of interfaces.

- _Flyweight Pattern_
  Reusing an object by sharing it.

- _Proxy Pattern_
  Representing another object.

## Implementation :

In this project I've used 3 structural design patterns: Facade, Bridge
